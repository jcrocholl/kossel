Release status
==============

These are Mr-What's tweaks to Johann's mini-kossel drawings
circa Feb. 2014.
The main changes are:

   * Attach the carriage to a base that can mount Delrin wheels
     that ride directly on the extrusion, instead of the
     linear bearing rails.

   * Added support material to make printing easier on Quelab's
     public RepRap printer (Hackerspace in Albuquerque, NM)

   * Simplified some parts.

   * Changed effector head to carry a different shaped hot-end.

   * Attempting to use pressure sensors on top of the NEMA-17 motors
     instead of the probe.  This will require new, very tight tolerance
     print bed mounts.

Upstream Project
================

Johann offers some free printed parts, on the condition that
once you get a printer working, you give away two (2) sets
of free parts to others.  After that, you are free to sell
printed parts.

See Johann's main source project for more details.
